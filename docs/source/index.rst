Welcome to tesspy's documentation!
==================================

Introduction
------------

tesspy is a python library for geographical tessellation. By discretizing urban areas,
it builds local geographical units that allow further quantitative analysis. In addition
to regular tessellation methods, such as square grid and hexagon grid, it builds irregular
tessellations, such as voronoi diagrams and city blocks, based on OpenStreetMap geospatial data.

The package is currently maintained by `@siavash-saki`_ and `@JoHamann`_.
